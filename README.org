#+TITLE: broadcast-channel-api

An example on how to use the BroadcastChannel Javascript API

You can check its compatibility and docs here:
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API]]

When served from the same origin, it is possible to stabilish a
BroadcastChannel in order to communicate between different browser
windows, tab pages, or browser contexts under iframes.

This is often used to implement a `one to many` communication between
pages.

Basic usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  const channel = new Broadcastchannel("event_bus");

  channel.postMessage("Hello! I am sending you this message!");

  channel.onmessage = function (e) {
    console.log("Recieved message: ", e.data);
  };

  channel.close();

#+END_SRC
